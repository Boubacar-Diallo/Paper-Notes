We are currently on a verge of a revolution in digital photography. Developments in computational
imaging and adoption of artificial intelligence have spawned new editing techniques that give impressive
results in astonishingly short time-frames. The advent of multi-sensor and multi-lens cameras will further
challenge many existing integrity verification techniques. As a result, it will be necessary to re-evaluate
our notion of image authenticity and look for new techniques that could work efficiently in this new
reality. The goal of this paper is to thoroughly review existing techniques for protection and verification
of digital image integrity. In contrast to other recent surveys, the discussion covers the most important
developments both in active protection and in passive forensic analysis techniques. Existing approaches
are analyzed with respect to their capabilities, fundamental limitations, and prospective attack vectors.
Whenever possible, the discussion is supplemented with real operation examples and a list of available
implementations. Finally, the paper reviews resources available in the research community, including
public data-sets and commercial or open-source software. The paper concludes by discussing relevant
developments in computational imaging and highlighting future challenges and open research problems.
